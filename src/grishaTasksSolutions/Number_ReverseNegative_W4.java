/*   Explanation:

          1. Check the Number:
                We would Start by checking if the number is negative. If itâ€™s not,
                just return it as is because this method only works for negative numbers.
	      2. Convert to String:
	            If the number is negative, we remove the negative sign by taking its absolute value.
	            Then, we convert the number to a string so that we can easily reverse it.
	      3. Reverse the Digits:
	            We Use a tool called StringBuilder, which has a built-in function to reverse strings.
	            This will give us the digits in reverse order.
	      4. Convert Back to a Number:
	            Then we Take the reversed string and convert it back into an integer.
	      5. Make It Negative Again:
	            Finally, we have to add the negative sign back to the reversed number and return it.



 /*   Write a return method that can reverse negative number and return it as int

             Example:
                input => -456
                output => -654
